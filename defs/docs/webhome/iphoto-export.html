<h1>Matte: iPhoto Export Plugin</h1>

<p>If you have a Mac and use iPhoto to organize your photos into albums, you can download and
install the Matte iPhoto Export Plugin which will allow you to export albums easily into Matte,
preserving your photo names, comments, keywords and ratings.</p>

<p>The iPhoto Export Plugin is currently a very early release. At present direct export of albums into Matte is not supported. Instead it will allow you to export an album as a zip archive that includes all your iPhoto metadata such as names, comments, keywords, and ratings. You can then import that zip archive into Matte using Matte's normal "Add" feature. The eventual goal for this plugin is to export albums directly from iPhoto into Matte.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>The plugin requires the following:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>OS X</dt>
	<dd>This plugin has been tested on OS X 10.5 on PPC G5 and G4 computers. It should work on 
	OS X 10.4 but this has not been tested. It may or may not work on other versions of OS X.</dd>
	
	<dt>iPhoto</dt>
	<dd>The plugin has been tested only with iPhoto 7. It may or may not work on 
	other versions of iPhoto.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Installing the plugin</h2>

<p>Once you've <a title="Go to download page" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103583&package_id=268707">downloaded the Matte iPhoto Export Plugin</a> disk image, mount the disk image by double-clicking on it. Then run the installer application that comes in the mounted disk image.</p>

<h2>Performing the export from iPhoto</h2>

<p>Follow these steps to export an album from iPhoto:</p>

<h3>Select album to export in iPhoto</h3>

<p>Click on the album you want to export in iPhoto. This can be any album, 
including "smart" albums. Note that nested albums will not be exported.</p>

<h3>Start export</h3>

<p>Choose to the <b>File &gt; Export</b> menu in iPhoto, and then the <b>Matte</b> tab in the <em>Export Photos</em> dialog that appears.</p>

</div>

<p>Update the settings in the export window to your liking and then click the <b>Export</b> button.</p>

<div class="note"><b>Please note</b> that not all fields are supported yet. In particular the <b>URL, Username, Password, Collection, and Auto Album</b> options can be ignored. If you want to export your original photos (usually this is the desired option), make sure the <b>Export originals</b> button is checked.</div>

<p>The export plugin will then prompt you for a folder to export the album to. After choosing the folder, it will export the album, all of the photos in the album, create a <em>metadata.xml</em> file, and then a zip archive comprised of the album photos and the metadata.xml file.</p>

</div>

<p>The zip archive will be named after the album you've exported, and this is the file you should then upload into Matte.</p>

<h3>Import the zip archive into Matte</h3>

<p>Now you can import the zip archive created by the previous step into Matte. Log into Matte, and from the <b>Add</b> screen, select zip file you just created, and be sure to check the <b>Auto Album</b>
checkbox so that Matte re-creates your albums for you.</p>

</div>

<p>After the import completes, you will have the album available in Matte, ready to be shared.</p>
