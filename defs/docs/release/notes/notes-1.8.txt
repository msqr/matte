Matte Release Notes

@VERSION@ @BUILD_DATE@

This update provides a new, more modern theme called Swipe. The theme
works with modern browsers and has a responsive design that works great
with mobile devices. A new JSON RESTful API has been added that helps
power the new Swipe theme. Many packages used internally by Matte have
been updated to newer versions, and the build system has moved to use
Apache Ivy for dependency management. Finally, the source has moved
to Github.

=======================================================================
Updates since 1.7 release

- Create new modern theme: Swipe. Integrates the PhotoSwipe photo 
  viewer (http://photoswipe.com/).

- Update to require Servlet 2.5 minimum.

- Switch to Apache Ivy based build.

- Update to sMeta 1.0.3

- Fix average rating calculation in Apache Derby SQL. (8dc842c)

- Update to Spring Framework 3.2.

- Start work on JSON RESTful API support. Endpoints implemented to
  support new Swipe theme.

- Create new optimized theme XSLT 2 support templates. Old XSLT 1
  templates remain to support old Woosh theme.

- Support theme XSLT to render HTML 5, with text/html content type.

- Add theme resource resolvers that simplifies theme resource URLs to
  simple paths like /matte/theme/1/css/swipe.css.

- Optimize date-based browse SQL queries by allowing queries to
  specify year range directly, rather than rely on XSLT to filter the
  results of all available data.

- Change album anonymous key generation so URL-unfriendly characters
  are no longer present. Now keys are hex MD5 hashes.

- Don't increment video "viewed" counts when streaming byte range
  requests. (82cc71c)

- Fix bug in setting appropriate file name for zip file in album
  download. (94a199f)

- Fix generated Postgres SQL to use "date with time zone" type for all
  date values, so that time zones are properly supported.

- Fix leak of Theme ThreadLocal objects. (5de6e14)

- Limit bytes read into memory to at most 4k when processing byte range
  requests. Previously the entire range would be read, which might be
  entire files. (4bdba58)

- Update demo Apache Tomcat to version 6.0.43.

- Include width/height values in items returned in virtual albums, to
  allow working with PhotoSwipe.
