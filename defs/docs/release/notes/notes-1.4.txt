Matte Release Notes

@VERSION@ @BUILD_DATE@

This is a small update to the 1.3 release to bring better support
for the Matte web service API and to update some internal technology
to more recent versions.

=======================================================================
Updates since 1.3 release

- Update to Spring 2.5 (from Spring 1.2).
  
- Update to Spring WS 1.5 (from 1.0).
  
- Support the AddMediaRequest web service with large embedded content.
  Rather than rely on MTOM or some other mechanism for handling large
  XML element content when uploading media to Matte using the web
  service API Matte can handle any sized content directly in the 
  request XML document, efficiently and without using much memory.
  This means it is much easier to write simple SOAP clients.

Notes on XSLT 2.0 changes since the 1.2 release

Since the 1.3 release, Matte now uses a Saxon XSLT 2.0 processor for
XSLT handling, rather than what is provided by default with the JDK
(Xalan XSLT 1.0 processor). Themes using pure 1.0 XSLT can run without
modification, but if any EXSLT functions are used those transformations
will break in this version of Matte. Saxon does not include support for
EXLST. The easiest way to work around this is to update the 
stylesheet to XSLT 2.0, which can easily accomplish most of the
features provided by EXLST.

An area where exsiting themes might break when converting to XSLT
2.0 is with generating XHTML output. When generating XHTML using
a root element such as <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
you must take care that all templates that generate XHTML elements
include the XHTML namespace, otherwise they will end up in an empty
namespace which will make browsers ignore those elements.

For example, if you have an XSLT 1.0 template like:

<xsl:template match="m:album">
	<li><xsl:value-of select="@name"/></li>
</xsl:template>

you will need to change it to this to work in XSLT 2.0:

<xsl:template match="m:album">
	<li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
		<xsl:value-of select="@name"/>
	</li>
</xsl:template>
