Matte Release Notes

@VERSION@ @BUILD_DATE@

This is a small update to the 1.2 release. A new XSLT 2.0 processor
is now included with Matte to work around a bug in the Sun XSLT
processor included in Java 6. Custom themes may break because of
this change (most notably EXSLT extensions are no longer available).


Updates since 1.2 release

- When downloading images make sure download file name HTTP header set
  to a sensible value (with a proper file extension).
  
- Include Saxon XSLT processor to work around Sun Java bug
  http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6537167.
  
- Fix bug where dynamic JavaScript theme resources were returned
  with a text/css MIME type.
  
- Include sMeta 0.7 for support of MP4 metadata extraction.

- Support im4java for image processing, which means both ImageMagick
  and GraphicsMagick can be used. This is a good alternative to
  using JMagick.
  
- Improved support for the Matte iPhoto Export Plugin.


Notes on XSLT 2.0 update

Matte now uses a Saxon XSLT 2.0 processor for XSLT handling, rather
than what is provided by default with the JDK (Xalan XSLT 1.0
processor). Themes using pure 1.0 XSLT can run without modification,
but if any EXSLT functions are used those transformations will
break in this version of Matte. Saxon does not include support for
EXLST. The easiest way to work around this is to update the 
stylesheet to XSLT 2.0, which can easily accomplish most of the
features provided by EXLST.

An area where exsiting themes might break when converting to XSLT
2.0 is with generating XHTML output. When generating XHTML using
a root element such as <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
you must take care that all templates that generate XHTML elements
include the XHTML namespace, otherwise they will end up in an empty
namespace which will make browsers ignore those elements.

For example, if you have an XSLT 1.0 template like:

<xsl:template match="m:album">
	<li><xsl:value-of select="@name"/></li>
</xsl:template>

you will need to change it to this to work in XSLT 2.0:

<xsl:template match="m:album">
	<li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
		<xsl:value-of select="@name"/>
	</li>
</xsl:template>
