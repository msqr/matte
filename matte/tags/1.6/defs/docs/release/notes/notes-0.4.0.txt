Matte Release Notes

@VERSION@ @BUILD_DATE@

  when uploading zip archives. No documentation writen for this
  feature yet. Used by simple iPhoto AppleScript export now 
  included with binary release.

  function attached. Problem noticed after deleting media items,
  followed by some other dialog-based action.

  media.

- Don't "remember" completed jobs after viewed once. This prevents 
  them from showing up as 100% completed on subsequent page refreshes.

  rasterized PNG images.

- Implement support for displaying icons for video (and audio) media 
  for which preview images cannot be extracted from.

  for MP3 files which then set the item name to the song title.

- Various documentation / JavaDoc fixes, updates.
