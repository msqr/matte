- Several bug fixes with Lucene search index support (deleting from
  index when deleting items, updating index when importing items).

- Generate theme.properties when exporting a theme (if one does not
  already exist).

- Implement support for setting album poster in main UI (for 
  specifying which album item appears in the browse UI and Atom feed).
  
- Delete generated cache files (e.g. thumbnails) when delete media 
  items.
  
- Add periodic job to clean out stale user registrations (users that
  registered but did not confirm their registration).

- Initial support for nested albums. Main UI for album drag & drop
  still buggy.
  
- Much improved handling of media item time zones.

- Fix bug in album sort-by-date handling to sort by correct item date
  instead of database creation date.

- Fix handling of non-ASCII characters by forcing UTF-8 HTTP
  request/response encoding. Now correctly store, process, and display
  text as UTF-8.
  
- Update to Scriptaculous 1.7 / Prototype 1.5.

- Redirect to logon page during Ajax requests that were redirected to
  the logon page.
  
- Don't thrown exception if sMeta throws MetadataNotSupportedException
  when importing items; allow the import and there just won't be any
  metadata for those items.
  
- Several front-end JavaScript bug fixes.
