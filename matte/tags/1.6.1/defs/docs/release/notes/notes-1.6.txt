Notes on XSLT 2.0 changes since the 1.2 release

Since the 1.3 release, Matte now uses a Saxon XSLT 2.0 processor for
XSLT handling, rather than what is provided by default with the JDK
(Xalan XSLT 1.0 processor). Themes using pure 1.0 XSLT can run without
modification, but if any EXSLT functions are used those transformations
will break in this version of Matte. Saxon does not include support for
EXLST. The easiest way to work around this is to update the 
stylesheet to XSLT 2.0, which can easily accomplish most of the
features provided by EXLST.

An area where exsiting themes might break when converting to XSLT
2.0 is with generating XHTML output. When generating XHTML using
a root element such as <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
you must take care that all templates that generate XHTML elements
include the XHTML namespace, otherwise they will end up in an empty
namespace which will make browsers ignore those elements.

For example, if you have an XSLT 1.0 template like:

<xsl:template match="m:album">
	<li><xsl:value-of select="@name"/></li>
</xsl:template>

you will need to change it to this to work in XSLT 2.0:

<xsl:template match="m:album">
	<li xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
		<xsl:value-of select="@name"/>
	</li>
</xsl:template>
