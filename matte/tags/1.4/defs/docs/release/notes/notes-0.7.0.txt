Matte Release Notes

@VERSION@ @BUILD_DATE@

***********************************************************************
Note: the database schema has changed from the previous 0.6 release.
To update a 0.6 release database to 0.7, see the setup/sql/release
directory included in this package. Run the appropriate setup script
for your database type.

This change alters the way albums are shared. You will need to 
re-visit your shared albums and re-share them with the new settings in 
order for them to appear in your browsable abum index or album feed.
***********************************************************************

Major Updates

- Implement search support in Woosh browse theme, which allows searching
  across all shared albums.
  
- Include basic Media Album export tool to export albums and their items
  from a Media Album database, generating a filesystem hierarchy and 
  metadata.xml for importing into Matte. See the "media-album-export" 
  Ant task included in the source build script.

- Main UI JavaScript performance improvements, which greatly improves 
  client responsiveness when viewing large collections or albums.
  
- Browse server-side performance improvements, for vastly better 
  performance of browsing large collections of media items. Now easily 
  return for users with many thousands of items/albums.
  
- Support for ordering child albums within an album.

- Update sharing settings so albums can be shared without publishing
  in album browse/feed UIs. This allows albums to be shared so you can
  give somebody the album URL, but the album won't appear in your 
  browsable album index or album feed.

  archives. Fixes potential out of memory errors and "too many open

  separator lines, causing overlap with albums with long descriptions.
  
- Update default JPEG-2000 user-agent regular expression to only return 
  JP2 images for Safari on Macintosh. Safari on Windows does not support
  JP2 natively.
  
- Fix CSS problem with main UI left-hand album/collection lists where 
  large numbers of albums/collections were cut off from screen. Now 
  allow scrolling of this area, but prevents hide/show linke from 
  working so this area no longer has the hide/show tab.
  
- Fix <updated> and <published> dates in Atom feeds.

- Remove all <a href="#"> tags from main UI menus, so page scroll is 
  not reset when menu items are clicked on.
