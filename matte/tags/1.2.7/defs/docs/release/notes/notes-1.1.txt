Matte Release Notes

@VERSION@ @BUILD_DATE@

This is a minor update to the 1.0 release to add some support for the
Matte Add Files applet and also the iPhoto Export Plugin. Aside from
those minor additions, this is functionally the same as version 1.0.

If you do not plan to use either of these features, there is no reason
to upgrade from the 1.0 release.

If you are interested in these features, see the documentation at
