<h1>Matte: iPhoto Export Plugin</h1>

<p>If you have a Mac and use iPhoto to organize your photos into albums, you can download and
install the Matte iPhoto Export Plugin which will allow you to export albums easily into Matte,
preserving your albums, photo names, comments, keywords and ratings.</p>

<p>This iPhoto plugin helps you export photos and movies from iPhoto into Matte. At present direct export of albums into Matte is not supported. Instead this plugin will create a zip archive that includes all your iPhoto metadata such as names, comments, keywords, and ratings. You can then import that zip archive into Matte using Matte's normal "Add" feature.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>The plugin requires the following:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>OS X 10.5</dt>
	<dd>This plugin has been tested on OS X 10.6 on an Intel Mac. It should work on 
	OS X 10.5 but this has not been tested. It should also work on PPC based Macs
	but this has not been tested.</dd>
	
	<dt>iPhoto 7 ('08)</dt>
	<dd>The plugin requires iPhoto 7 (iPhoto â€™08) or later to run. In addition exporting movies requires Matte 1.3 or later and exporting photos requires Matte 1.2 or later.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Installing the plugin</h2>

<p>Once you've <a title="Go to download page" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103583&package_id=268707">downloaded the Matte iPhoto Export Plugin</a> disk image, mount the disk image by double-clicking on it. Then copy the <code>MatteiPhotoExport.iPhotoExporter</code> folder included in this release into the <code>~/Library/Application Support/iPhoto/Plugins</code> folder (create these folders if they do not exist).</p>

<h2>Performing the export from iPhoto</h2>

<p>Follow these steps to export an album from iPhoto:</p>

<h3>Select album to export in iPhoto</h3>

<p>Click on the album you want to export in iPhoto. This can be any album, 
including "smart" albums. Note that nested albums will not be exported.</p>

</div>

<h3>Start export</h3>

<p>Choose to the <b>File &gt; Export</b> menu in iPhoto, and then the <b>Matte</b> tab in the <em>Export Photos</em> dialog that appears.</p>

</div>

<p>Update the settings in the export window to your liking and then click the <b>Export</b> button.</p>

<p>The export plugin will then prompt you for a folder to export the album to. After choosing the folder, it will export the album, all of the photos in the album, create a <em>metadata.xml</em> file, and then a zip archive comprised of the exported files and the metadata.xml file.</p>

</div>

<p>The zip archive will be named after the album you've exported, and this is the file you should then upload into Matte.</p>

<h3>Import the zip archive into Matte</h3>

<p>Now you can import the zip archive created by the previous step into Matte. Log into Matte, and from the <b>Add</b> screen, select zip file you just created, and click the "Add" button.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
	<img src="img/iphoto-add-export.png" alt="Import items into Matte" width="528" height="368" />
	<div>Import the items into Matte.</div>
</div>

<p>After the import completes, you will have the photos and movies available in Matte, ready to be shared.</p>
