- Added drag-and-drop GUI for manually ordering items within an album.

- Add ability to configure self-registration feature to be disabled,
  for sites that don't want users to be able to set up their own 
  accounts. The Setup Wizard can be used to turn this feature on/off.
  
- Added "forgot password" support, allowing a user to have a new 
  password generated and emailed to the account's email address.
  
- Ability to auto-rotate images with EXIF orientation flags.

- Ability to download the selected items in the main GUI as a zip 
  archive. Works in background, displaying progress as items are 
  exported to the zip archive.
