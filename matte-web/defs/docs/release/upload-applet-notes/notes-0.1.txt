Matte Add Files Applet Release Notes

@VERSION@ @BUILD_DATE@

This is the Matte "Add Files" Applet distribution. This is the first
public release of this applet. The applet works well for most 
simple cases, but there are still some bugs remaining to be fixed.

The applet requires Matte 1.1 or later to function.

To install the applet, sign the matte-upload-applet.jar file, copy the
signed JAR into the Matte "applet" folder (within the Matte WAR), and
use the Matte Setup Wizard to enable the Add Files applet feature.
