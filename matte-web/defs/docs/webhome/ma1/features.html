<a name="about"></a>
<p class="intro">Why does the world need Media Album -- aren't there already dozens of web-based photo applications similar to Media Album?</p>

<p>
	There certainly are! I counted up 20 or so within an hour of casual web-surfing
	recently. Media Album actually began life in September 2002. After frustration
	over not being able to easily share photos with family and friends I looked
	around for a free solution. None of the solutions at the time fit my needs exactly,
	thus Media Album was born. You should evaluate your photo/movie sharing needs
	and pick a web-based application that serves you well! That being said, here are
	some of the features which differentiate Media Album from other similar applications:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Java web application</dt>
	<dd>
		Most other web photo sharing applications are written in PHP. If you
		don't run PHP on your web server then you're out of luck. Media
		Album is a Java web application, however. In a most basic setting
		you only need two things to run Media Album (not counting a database):
		a Java application server and Media Album. There are several high-quality
		and completely free Java application servers available like
		<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Apache Tomcat</a> or
		<a href="http://www.jboss.org/">JBoss</a>. You don't need any other
		libraries like GD installed, and you don't even need to have a separate
		web server.
	</dd>

	<dt>High performance that won't take down your server</dt>
	<dd>
		Media Album is designed to handle thousands upon thousands of media items.
		Since it scales the items and compresses them on the fly according to
		user preferences it can also take up a great deal of your server's
		processing capabilities. Media Album can safely respond to many
		simultaneous requests without overloading your server, however, by making
		use of work schedulers and queues. Sounds fancier than it might actually
		be, but just know that when 50 of your closest friends attempt to download
		your latest album of 1,000 photos, all scaled from 4000x2000 to 640x480
		and rotated as necessary and re-compressed, your server will graciously
		oblige without resorting to consuming all your memory and crashing your
		hard drive. You can even adjust how much processing Media Album will
		attempt to do at once so you tune Media Album to run on your old original
		iMac on up to your personal X-processor mega server.
	</dd>

	<dt>Insanely customizable</dt>
	<dd>
		Did I say insanely? Yes, in fact it is true. Media Album has been
		designed with many different viewing mediums in mind, from viewing
		albums over your cell phone to viewing them as PDF documents. For
		the most part people will view your albums using their favorite
		web browser, however, so that is where Media Album concentrates
		right now. But even within the world of HTML much flexibility is
		granted to Media Album themes. Media Album themes are not simple
		templates, they rely on XSLT to transform XML data into whatever
		sort of form you'd like. Media Album also allows you to manage
		your own themes and install them without stopping/starting the
		application.
	</dd>

	<dt>Time zone support</dt>
	<dd>
		Have you ever travelled to, say, Hawaii from your hometown of, say,
		New York, and taken photos with your digital camera? Perhaps you
		wondered after you returned to New York why those photos taken
		during breakfast on the beach say they were taken at 4 AM? At least
		you don't remember getting up that early... With Media Album you get
		to specify your camera's time zone, and then you can specify the
		time zone individual items were created in. Thus those 4 AM photos
		would appear as 9 AM for you. Mystery solved!
	</dd>

	<dt>Watch for updates</dt>
	<dd>
		You can elect to watch entire Media Album libraries or individual
		albums for updates. When new items are added that Media Album will
		send you a friendly email telling you so.
	</dd>

	<dt>Email photos</dt>
	<dd>
		You can email photos to your friends, either as attachments in the
		email itself or in the form of a URL link.
	</dd>

	<dt>Watermarks</dt>
	<dd>
		Emblazon your images with a watermark of your design so that no matter
		what chain email your photo travels with, it will always carry your
		personal signature.
	</dd>

	<dt>Custom meta data</dt>
	<dd>
		Media Album lets you assign <em>types</em> to media, which allow you to
		add useful meta data to items. For example the custom types include a
		<em>book</em> type, which allows you to add an <em>author</em> and
		<em>publisher</em> to the media. In this way you can upload a scanned
		image of a
		book cover and also save the author and publisher as meta data fields.
		These meta data fields can then be searched, allowing you to, for
		example, find all books you have by a specific author.
	</dd>

	<dt>Download albums</dt>
	<dd>
		Media Album lets you download entire albums as a zip file. You can
		choose to download items scaled to your view settings (eg. 640 x 480)
		or the original media items. Either way Media Album creates the zip
		for you on the fly.
	</dd>

	<dt>Ratings</dt>
	<dd>
		Rate your media items from 1-10. You can then browse all your items
		according to your ratings. If you are logged in to Media Album you
		can also rate other users' media items. You can then browse their
		items according to your ratings. You can also browse other users'
		media items by their owner's ratings. Or you can browse anyone's
		media items by the average of all ratings. Any way you slice it,
		ratings give you great flexibility to keep track of your favorites,
		and other people's favorites.
	</dd>

	<dt>Lightbox</dt>
	<dd>
		Media Album provides you with a shopping cart-like holding area for
		media items you come across while browsing, called a <em>lightbox</em>.
		While browsing if something strikes your fancy you can add it to your
		lightbox. Then from your lightbox you can do things to those items in
		it, like email or download them. For example, maybe you want
		only 10 of the 99 photos in somebody's album. With the lightbox feature
		you simply add those 10 to your lightbox then download them all as a zip
		file, saving you quite a bit in download time if you're on a slow
		internet connection.
	</dd>

	<dt>Quotas</dt>
	<dd>
		You can assign quotas to users on your Media Album system to limit
		the number of items they can upload.
	</dd>
