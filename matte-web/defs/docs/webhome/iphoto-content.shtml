<p class="intro">If you use iPhoto to organise your photos on a Mac, you might 
like to try the Matte iPhoto Export Plugin, which allows you to export entire albums
directly from iPhoto into Matte.</p>

<p>You can download the plugin from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/malbum/files/Matte%20iPhoto%20Export%20Plugin/">here</a>. 
See the <a href="iphoto-export.html">Matte iPhoto Export Plugin</a> page for more information.</p>

<p>In addition, there is an AppleScript included in the binary distribution of Matte for 
exporting an album from iPhoto. This script may work with older version of iPhoto not supported
by the Matte iPhoto Export Plugin. See the <a href="iphoto-applescript-export.html">Matte iPhoto
Export AppleScript</a> page for more information.</p>

<div class="note"><b>Are you a Cocoa developer?</b> The Matte project could use your help! If 
interested, see the <a href="developers.shtml">Developers</a> page for more information.</div>
